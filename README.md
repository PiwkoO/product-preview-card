## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned about theme-color meta tag which, from a user interface perspective, makes it look better on mobile devices. Also, a while ago I read an article about new CSS units, so I dove deeper into it. I think it is a very neat way of improving styling.  


```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#f2ebe3" />
```
```css
body {
  min-height: 100svh;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Values and Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#viewport-variants) - This helped me to understand the purpose for new viewport units.
- [New CSS viewport units and minimum heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7judyqwqmKo) - Above documentation is very technical so this video gave me a better understanding how it works in practice. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
